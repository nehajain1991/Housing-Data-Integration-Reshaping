# Housing-Data-Integration-Reshaping
Integration of the Housing data of Melbourne after Reshaping

The code takes in data from several sources and integrates it to give better information for housing. For instance, we can now know things such as time to closest shopping centre from a house or how much time it takes to reach the city from a house. Data is reshaped in required format.

Different formats of the files were provided as the Inputs like JSON, XML, CSV, HTML and Shape files. They were integrated and reshaped to form the final output file providing the above information.
